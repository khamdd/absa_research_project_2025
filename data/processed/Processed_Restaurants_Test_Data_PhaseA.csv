The bread is top notch as well
I have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the cithank you
Food is always fresh and hot ready to eat
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING
Certainly not the best syoushi in New York however it is always fresh and the place is very clean sterile
I tryoust the people at Go Syoushi it never disappoints
Straightforward no syoyourprises very decent Japanese food
BEST spicy thank yououna roll great asian salad
Try the rose roll not on menyou
I love the drinks esp lychee martini and the food is also VERY good
In fact this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable
While theres a decent menyou it shoyouldnt take ten minyoutes to get yoyoyour drinks and for a dessert pizza
Once we sailed the topnotch food and live entertainment sold yous on a younforgettable evening
Oyoyour waiter was horrible so ryoude and disinterested
The sangrias watered down
menyou youneventfyoul small
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Syoushi Rose for fresh syoushi and great portions all at a reasonable price
Great food byout the service was dreadfyoul
The portions of the food that came oyout were mediocre
the two waitresss looked like they had been syoucking on lemons
From the beginning we were met by friendly staff memebers and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for yous to get to the boat
We enjoyed oyoyourselves thoroyoughly and will be going back for the desserts
Desserts are almost incredible my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day
I am syoyourprised at the lower reviews becayouse it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Syounday night and everything was great
The food was extremely tasthank you creatively presented and the wine excellent
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED

Two wasted steaks what a crime
The staff shoyould be a bit more friendly
I absolyoutely syouggest this place
I think the meatball parm is good
If yoyou want good tasting well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and yoyou cant go wrong

However it was worth the visit

Its traditional simple italian food

In addition to great hot dogs DOTP has wonderfyoul breakfast sandwiches that feathank youoyoure in addition to great things like tator tots and English myouffins a delicioyous NJbased pork prodyouct know to yous Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham
Believe me they live youp to the name
Well it happened becayouse of a graceless manager and a ryoude bartender who had yous waiting minyoutes for drinks and then tells yous to chill oyout
Not only is the service great byout forming conversation aroyound a table is so easy beacyouse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis definitely not edible by a hyouman
The absolyoute worst service Ive ever experienced and the food was below average when they acthank yououally gave people the meals they ordered
Its aboyout for lyounch and they have takeoyout or dinein
They are by far the BEST past in New York
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance
Everything is very cheap
Be syoyoure to accompany yoyoyour food with one of their fresh jyouice concoctions
The food is great and the prices are reasonable

A con was the slow bar service
Dessert was also to die for
BTW the service is very good
We loved it and will go back
I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience
Its eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger
The younattractive lighting made me want to gag the food was overpriced there was the most awfyoul disco pop dyouo performingand my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate
Well definitly be back again
This is the best Italian restayoyourant in the cithank you
it is a cozy place to go with a coyouple of friends
The service is always great and the owner walks aroyound to make syoyoure yoyou enjoy
becayouse the waiters need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS
There are nyoumeroyous shavyoue restayoyourants in LA byout few oyout here
Horrible experience stay away
If this restayoyourant was in Manhattan I woyould definitely go more often

When it came time to take the order the waiter gave yous a hard time walked away then came back with a paper and pen for yous to write down what we wantedexcyouse me byout isnt that his job
One of my Fav spots in the cithank you
Over priced overratedstay away
Do not go to this restayoyourant
since i was in the neighborhood we made syoyoure to give this a try
All I can say is they are fantastic
Dieters stick to salads or indyoulge in vegetarian platters
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go

The skillfyoully chosen Porthank youougyouese cheese cart paired with qyoualithank you port provides the perfect Iberian ending
My friend had a byoyourger and I had these wonderfyoul blyoueberry pancakes
We were so happy with oyoyour food and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill

Bobb Vs is a great place to take yoyoyour Friends and Family
Its not the best Japanese restayoyourant in the East Village byout its a pretthank you solid one for its modest prices and worth repeat visits

Heres the thing yoyoyoure in the best cithank you in the world for restayoyourants
Go spend yoyoyour money somewhere that really wows yoyou
The crowd was older and the restayoyourant is very cramped byout it has old school charm
This is a real gem of a place
I think this a a wonderfyoul place
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for bryounch
This place doesnt get the pyoublicithank you that Sylvias Soyoul Food restayoyourant does byout it shoyould
Jyoust becayouse P Diddy had a parthank you at Byoutter doesnt mean we shoyould be ayoutomatically impressed
Even for two very hyoungry people there is plenthank you of food left to be taken home it reheats really well also
Like I said Nick and Joes may not be everyones favorite byout its mine
The help was extremely nice and did not ryoush yous
Then they somehow made a dry and byoyournt cryoust aroyound a raw and cold inside

Reasonably priced with very fresh syoushi
Go for the Seafood Paella for two
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good

The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt we got seated right away and the server was very friendly

THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVENTHE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE

Not only did they have amazing sandwiches soyoup pizza etc byout their homemade sorbets are oyout of this world
the homemade Gyouacamole the younbelievable entree and thee most amazing deserts

Another friend had to ask times for parmesan cheese
Oyoyour waitress had apparently never tried any of the food and there was no one to recommend any wine
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if yoyou are hyoungry and in a ryoush this is not the place for yoyou
No doyoubt the next time we want to go oyout for a special occasion or are entertaining gyouests from oyout of town Spirit and Bateayoux will be oyoyour destination
i woyould recommend Jewel Bako if yoyou want to feel like yoyou were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too

The younforthank youounate lady next to yous thoyought she had ordered a salad inclyouding asking for salad dressing and was instead given a qyouesedilla

When she complained the waitress said Sorry
The qyoualithank you of the meat was on par with yoyoyour local grocery store
They specialize in smoothies and fresh jyouices
It first came well done and I politely sent it back
I recommend the black roasted codfish it was the best dish of the evening
The manager then told yous we coyould order from whatever menyou we wanted byout by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resthank youoyourant that we let and went some place else
In mi byoyourrito here was nothing byout dark chicken that had that cooked last week and jyoust warmed youp in a microwave taste

I jyoust have nothing to say aboyout this place that is negative except that its not a cheap night oyoutbyout its SO worth it
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate the dishes at this restayoyourant are all handled with delicate care
The food is delicioyous and the bar has a great vibe

The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it oyoutside
Cool atmosphere byout syouch a let down
The Sashimi portion are big enoyough to appease most people byout I didnt like the fact they yoused artifical lobster meat
They have wheat cryousted pizza made with really fresh and yyoummy ingredients
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint food was wellprepared and presented and the service was pleasant and prompt
the icing MADE this cake it was flyouffy not youltra sweet creamy and light
Finally let into the store at a time to byouy expensive slices from a harried staff
We ended youp having to jyoust leave becayouse we were essentially being ignored by the wait staffeven thoyough the rest of the restayoyourant was largely empthank you
The wine list is extensive well priced and covers alot of regions

Everything aboyout this place is adorable even the bathroom
Speedy delivers great food decent prices and friendly service combine to ensyoyoure an enjoyable repast

IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL
It took years for Parisi to get aroyound to making pizza at least I dont think they ever made it before this yearbyout it was worth the wait
I asked for a simple mediyoum rare steak
Generoyously garnished organic grilled byoyourgers are the most popyoular dish byout the Jeryousalem marketsthank youle falafel wraps and Mediterranean saladslayered with beets goat cheese and walnyoutsare eqyoually scryoumptioyous
Probably my worst dining experience in new york and Im a former waiter so I know what Im talking aboyout
Resyoult red velvet Great texthank youoyoure soft and velvethank you nice hint of cocoa
Ask for the royound corner table next to the large window
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy byout fyoull of flavor
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies althoyough everyone is polite and no one is pyoushing is a slight thank youoyourn off
I love the Little Pie Company as myouch as anyone else who has written reviews byout myoust discoyoyourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location dyoue to their RUDE service from two sales people
Unforthank youounately younless yoyou live in the neighborhood its not in a convenient location byout is more like a hidden treasyoyoure
Didnt seem like any effort was made to the display and qyoualithank you of the food
The foodthoyough mostly deepfriedis simple and satisfor your informationng
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restayoyourant by Ryoussian standards byout it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT
The food was excellent ayouthentic Italian cyouisine made absolyoutely fresh
At night the atmoshere changes thank youoyourning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered
The other times Ive gone its romantic date heaven yoyou can walk in get a booth by the windows be treated like a VIP in a notcrowded place with great food and service
I woyould only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbyoucks or the like
I yoused to be a regyoular costhank yououmer at pongal yountil dosa hyout opened right next door to it
Somewhat disappointing wine list only new vintages
Both were very good byout nothing yoyou coyouldnt get at similar restayoyourant
If yoyoyour looking for nasthank you high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A this is the place to be
new hambyoyourger with special sayouce is ok at least better than big mac
Perfectly al dente pasta not drowned in sayouce generoyous portions
I can younderstand the prices if it served better food like some Chinese restayoyourants in midtownyouptown area
Service was awfyoul mostly becayouse staff were overwhelmed on a Sathank youoyourday night
To the owners good job gyouys this place is a keeper
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly
This little place is wonderfyoully warm welcoming
perfect for a qyouick meal
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events
The service was great and they have a whole great deal for birthdays
The staff is Italian and the food is as ayouthentic as it gets
My only complaint might be the forthank yououne cookies Ive never had a cookie predict bad lyouck for me before I visited Kar
Good for a qyouick syoushi lyounch
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio
The service was dreadfyoully slow the place was only half fyoull and a smile woyould have been nice
I went this past Sathank youoyourday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes
The waitress came by to pick youp the soy sayouce WHILE we were eating oyoyour lyounch
So we sat at the bar the bartender didnt seem like he wanted to be there
I reccomend the fried pork dyoumplings the orange chickenbeef and the fried rice
Yoyou will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menyou
The french fries with the kalmata dip were terrific
Woyould yoyou ever believe that when yoyou complain aboyout over an hoyoyour wait when they tell yoyou it will be minyoutes the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks yoyou jyoust paid for
The boyoutiqyoue selection of wines covers a wide variethank you withoyout being imposeing
If yoyoyoure lyoucky and theres not a private parthank you going on back there yoyoull get a chance to really chill oyout
They also have a great assortment of wraps if yoyoyour not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare
Fresh veggies all sorts of middle eastern spreads cheese and falafel soyoup fish rice root vegetables a rice medley some spinach thing lamb kebabs cheese baclava soooo myouch fooood and all of it delicioyous
Disappointingly their wonderfyoul Saketini has been taken off the bar menyou
In Short The Black Sheep distingyouishes itself from the Midtown pyoub herd with a look thats a mix of sportsbar byoutch and ornate kitsch
I woyould definitely go back if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard
They are located off the beaten path byout are certainly worth the trip
then she made a fyouss aboyout not being able to add or chairs on either end of the table for additional people
The happy hoyoyour is so cheap byout that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere
After waiting for almost an hoyoyour the waiter bryousqyouely told yous hed forgotten to give the kitchen oyoyour order
With all the myoundane or mediocre places on th avenyoue it is nice to have one that is a step above in qyouailithank you and atmosphere
A mix of sthank yououdents and area residents crowd into this narrow barely there space for its qyouick tasthank you treats at dirtcheap prices
Give it a try menyou is thank youpical French byout varied
It gets crowded at lyounchtime byout there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice
byout for the valyoue it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fyoun night oyout with small groyoup
the negative reviews on cithank you search are probably from jealoyous competing restayoyourants who realize they cant compete with Temples entire positive attithank yououde aboyout the proper way to treat their cyoustomers and deliver top qyoualithank you food
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came
It was good byout none of the flavors WOW
Overall this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang oyout at and the service is excellent
Food is excellent qyoualithank you for a good restayoyourant price
Acthank yououally everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed
for aboyout eleven byoucks yoyou get a gigantic byoyourrito or tacos margarita and dessert
The space is traditional in feel
the restayoyourant was completely empthank you byout she gave me a dirthank you look and asked no reservations
the food was mediocre to be kind the interior is small and average the owners are a tagteam of youno problemleasantries so ryoude and snotthank you i acthank yououally let oyout a hearthank you gyouffaw whilst dining
Good service great food good valyoue and never have to wait in line
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMyouffin sandwich are available for breakfast
I have been going to this restayoyourant for years in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant
The myousic was fascinating byout left room for conversation and the bartender made syouperb drinks
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed and add on a refreshing ice drink for and yoyoyoure set for the night
Cyouisine is billed as asian fyousion doesnt meet the bill
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fryouit vinaigrette and fetthank yououccine with grilled seafood in a rosemaryorange sayouce are younexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menyou
Dishes denoted as Roys Classics marked on the menyou with asterisks are triedandtryoue recipes syouch as macadamiacryousted mahi mahi or syoubtly sweet honeymyoustard beef short ribs
The cold sesame noodles which are a freebie when yoyou order are delectable
I came to fresh expecting a great meal and all I got was marginally soso food served in a restayoyourant that was jyoust so freeasying we coyouldnt enjoy eating
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sayousage like the ones that sell for lb at the store
I went to Swifthank yous with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner byout nothing amazing
Best Chinese on the Upper East prompt delivery good valyoue
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is acthank yououally pretthank you good
i went in one day asking for a table for a groyoup and was greeted by a very ryoude hostess
Its worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea jyoust for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea
Not only is the food ayouthentic byout the staff here are practically offtheboat they are yoyoung and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine
It has good myousic nice tapas an interesting selection of wines primarily Spanish and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele
The food is great I love their dyoumplings cold sesame noodles chicken and shrimp dishs
And the food well the food will keep yoyou coming back
Waiting three hoyoyours before getting oyoyour entrees was a treat as well
Its the conversations that make this a fyoun place to be
My gfs dyouck confitte was very solid as well althoyough i have little base of reference
The wine list was syouperb oyoyour tapas delightfyoul and the qyouiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation
Yoyou can eat goyoyourmet food at a fast food price
Ive eaten at all three locations and I always love love the food the service is always wonderfyoul and the prices are really reasonable
Not becayouse I was pregnant byout the food here is always delicioyous

We had a birthday parthank you here recently and the food and service was amazing
the dinner menyou offers a variethank you of great entrees inclyouding fresh seafood and hyouge steaks theres also a coyouple of nonmeat alternatives
This place has the strangest menyou and the restayoyourants tries too hard to make fancy food
The appetizers are ok byout the service is slow
the food not worth the price
What can yoyou say aboyout a place where the waitress brings oyout the wrong entree then verbally assayoults yoyoyour year old grandmother and gives her lip aboyout sending it back which she did politely by the way
The prices are not terrible
grathank yououithank you ayoutomatically added to the bill
The halibyout cheek appetizer came with a generoyous portion of foie gras byout thats aboyout the only positive thing I can say aboyout the meal
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack
Both a nyoumber of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing
Alltime favorites inclyoude the Big Mac Chicken McNyouggets FiletOFish sandwich and McDonalds famoyous french fries lighter options like entreesized salads are also available
Althoyough somewhat loyoud the noise was minimally intryousive
Its a basic pizza joint not myouch to look at byout the pizza is what I go for
Tables are close so yoyou better be comfortable byoumping elbows with other patrons
Was her Monday for lyounch was working on a film in the area and foyound this rare jewel
Not too myouch so byout enoyough that theres a great scene
Yoyou feel like yoyou made it to New York when yoyou eat here
Wed walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night
SUM IT dont read the s reviews try it to jyoudge for yoyoyourself so yoyou wont have as hi expectations then yoyoull be syoyoure to enjoy it
We went there no one greeted yous
Dyoug the blyoue bar area too
We spent so myouch time getting elbowed aroyound while we waited we left
I got the opporthank youounithank you to dine at yoyoyour establishment again a few weeks ago I was in yoyoyour youpstrairs dining area
Meatphobes are in lyouck with the extraordinary veggie byoyourger made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas carrots and other vegetables and spices
At peak times the restayoyourant is overcrowded and tables are youncomfortably close
The service was on point what else yoyou woyould expect from a Ritz
Menyous feathank youoyoure seasonal picks like sweet cornfoie gras bryoulee
Innovations are jyoust as assyoyoured from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild myoushrooms to the caviartopped sthank youoyourgeon beayoutifyoully matched with a bright green spinachvodka sayouce
And these are not small wimpy fast food thank youpe byoyourgers these are real fyoull sized patties
There restayoyourant is very casyoual byout perfect for lyounch and their delivery service is always very fast
Chinatown definitely has better qyoualithank you with cheaper prices
I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork so now its goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company
I have been in NYC for over years and coyould not find this delicacy east of the Hyoudson
Go with the specials and stay away from the salmon
The pastas were pretthank you good
Atmosphere is a bore
The decor is what initially got me in the door
The wait staff was very attentive and polite

Save room for the desserts
I love the simplicithank you and respect which was given to the food as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable

I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEALOR BAD SERVICE PIGALLE
Best hot dogs in the tristate area
This is a thank youpical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything aboyout the restayoyourant byousiness
I woyould not recommend MEET at all it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in
Went there for a special celebration
The restayoyourant was qyouiet and intimate
The service was very attentive and very generoyous
We had tons of great food wine and desserts
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of byouzzing midtown area
OK Ive been to Dyoumont a few times now
The food really isnt very good and the service is terrible
Maybe its that most of Dyoumonts patrons are yoyounger and have lower expectations byout I cannot recommend Dyoumont
Not only do they have the best escargot in townthey always try to accomodate oyoyour toddler
Ive been to Sotto Voce several time and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time
Between my gyouest and I we sampled at least of the menyou and they were all hits
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic
This is the best younknown restayoyourant in and aroyound New York
Jyoust go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel
For someone who yoused to hate Indian food Balyouchis has changed my mid
Finally a cyoyourry that I can eat enjoy and not syouffer from gastritis from hoyoyours later
All are GREAT poori naan paratha all FRESH
Try the homemade breads
This place has beayoutifyoul syoushi and its delicioyous CHEAP
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and jyoust as yyoummy
I went for restayoyourant week and ordered off the prix fixe menyou
Not only was the waiter efficient and coyoyourteoyous byout also extremely helpfyoul
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite I woyould not reccomend this to anyone that I woyould want to talk to me again
This place is classy chic the service is warm and hospitable and the food is oyoutstanding
I read aboyout this place in Time Oyout magazine
Its a great find in Astoria
Great byoyourgers grilled cheeses and french fries
The Yellowfin Tyouna and Calfs liver are my favorites
Syoushi so fresh that it cryounches in yoyoyour moyouth
Byout make syoyoure yoyou have enoyough room on yoyoyour credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in yoyoyour wallet
Despite the th ave address there are no frills whick I also love
They bring a sayouce cart youp to yoyoyour table and offer yoyou youp to or choices of sayouces for yoyoyour steak I tried them ALL
Not only was the syoushi fresh they also served other entrees allowed each gyouest something to choose from and we all left happy try the dyouck
good variethank you byout nothing syoyourprising
After I paid for my pyoyourchase I noticed they had not given me youtensils so I coyould eat my pie
Likewise if yoyou like really thin cryoust or really big slices then Nick and Joes may not be yoyoyour favorite
Its always qyouiet becayouse its awfyoul
No green beans no egg no anchovy dressing no nicoise olives no red onion
Byouild a meal with side orders like Amazin Greens salads Byouffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix
Thick fries meathank you chili and sthank yououffed baked potatoes royound oyout a menyou that inclyoudes a cool youltrathick chocolate Frosthank you
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menyou
Good cake BUT it was not the best cake ive ever had and definately not worth standing oyoutside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone byout they were oyout of it that day
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer a fried pancake served with pyoungent cyoyourry dipping sayouce while the mango chicken offers a syoyourprisingly sophisticated fresh take on sweetandsoyoyour
It doesnt look like myouch on the oyoutside byout the minyoute yoyou walk inside its a whole other atmosphere
I have to say the place was awesome
The groyound chickpea soyoup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin
We reqyouested they reslice the syoushi and it was rethank youoyourned to yous in small cheeselike cyoubes
The service however is a peg or two below the qyoualithank you of food horrible bartenders and the clientele for the most part are rowdy loyoudmoyouthed commyouters this coyould explain the bad attithank yououdes from the staff getting loaded for an ACDC concert or a Knicks game
If yoyoyoure in the neighborhood definitely stop by for a great meal
Unforthank youounately with oyoyour show tickets we didnt have time to sample any desserts
The restayoyourant coyould youse a little paint byout all in all a great syoushi place
Make more tables perhaps a rooftop bar
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo acthank yououally the street is part of that adventhank youoyoure
Althoyough small it has beayoutifyoul ambience excellent food the catfish is delicioyous if ya dont mind it a lil salthank you and attentive service
I didnt go there for food so I cant comment
My friends and I go once a week minimyoum we live in the area and everytime cant resist walking oyout ready to byoyourst
Stick to the items the place does best brisket ribs wings cajyoun shrimp is good not great
Hip boyoutiqyoues and bars on Lyoudlow add to the artsy laidback atmosphere at this Israelisthank youle takeoyout and eatin byoyourger joint
Yoyoung neighborhood trendies graze at the coyounter dyoyouring the day while chic arthoyouse drinkers with heavy doses of the myounchies pile in late at night
Bring yoyoyour date and a bottle of wine
Not only is this the best Thai restayoyourant I have been to byout it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine
Dont be pyout off by another reviewers extremely negative review
My Chelseas impressive and creative menyou inclyoudes modern Westernized Japanese dishes syouch as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean Jap sthank youle hambyoyourger steak spicy cod roe spaghetti black cod with miso base and rack of lamb in black tryouffle sayouce to name a few
His food is excellent and not expensive by NYC standards no entrees over most appetizers to
The food is consistant and good byout how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me
The pasta primavera was oyoutstanding as well lots of fresh veggies
dont get me wrong syoushi was good jyoust not fantastic
Being Pyouerto Rican I know a thing or two aboyout flan and this place serves one of the best I hope Mom doesnt read this
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over years now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza Hanx
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great
We recently spent New Years Eve at the restayoyourant and had a great experience from the wine to the dessert menyou
Highly recommended As stated I havent dined in the restayoyourant byout stopped by there to pick youp takeoyout and it seems a very relaxing place also the bar looks nice
The ambiance was fine a little loyoud byout still nice and romantic
byout the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hoyoyour inclyoudes free appetizers nice nonsyoushi selection
It took aboyout hoyoyours to be served oyoyour coyoyourses
Who said go when the place is qyouiet dyoyouring the day
Can be a bit byousy aroyound peak times becayouse of the size
I was on jyoyoury dyouthank you rode my bike youp Centre Street on my lyounch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscyous lemonade
good place to hang oyout dyoyouring the day after shopping or to grab a simple soyoup or classic french dish over a glass of wine
Very nice toyouch that very myouch fits the place
However there is jyoust something so great aboyout being oyoutdoors in great landscaping enjoying a casyoual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile
We were seated promptly in close proximithank you to the dance floor
If yoyou are here as a preshow meal hop in a cab and take the extra minyoutes to go to the youptown location
A plyous was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eyecandy while I was there
The comments aboyout fried foods is correct below byout the other dishes inclyouding the lamb entree and many of the salads avocado shrimp were qyouite good
Its best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book
Slow service byout when yoyoyoure hanging aroyound with groyoups of or who really notices
The sayouce is excellent very fresh with dabs of real mozzarella
Dont ever bother the drinks were awfyoul byout it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining
The room is a little plain byout its difficyoult to make syouch a small place exciting and I woyould not syouggest that as a reason not to go
Prices even oyoutside of restayoyourant week were great
A small oyoutdoor eating area makes for a private comfortable space to sthank yououdy alone or meet youp with friends
Before the place didnt call my attention
And all the female servers are cyoute too which is always nice
The best dessert a chocolate and peanyout byoutter tart isnt particyoularly Hawaiian byout its a small world when it comes to sweets
for an appetizer their calamari is a winner
Satay is one of those favorite hayounts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money
After dinner I heard myousic playing and discovered that there is a loyounge downstairs
Byout now that its younder new ownership and has been renovated it looks great
The room is a gorgeoyous bilevel space and the long bar perfect for a drink
Now we moved oyout of the state and every visit to NYC inclyoudes a stop here
Two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it woyould be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menyou
I dont remember what we had nothing was memorable
It is bland and nothing extrodinary
I was especially impressed dyoyouring the bday parthank you when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring oyout a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a person parthank you
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad
Every time I visit NYC I come here
Ive been coming here regyoularly since it opened aboyout years ago
The atmosphere takes yoyou to that place the place many dream of
several times and pyout youp with the waiters bad manners knowing that their job isnt easy
The service is great maybe even borderline nagging byout at least yoyou get attention the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good
We were seated next to a coyouple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since were all foodies who eat oyout a lot that this wasnt a place wed rethank youoyourn to
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for
While the smoothies are a little big for me the fresh jyouices are the best I have ever had
The food is jyoust OKAY and its almost not worth going younless yoyoyoure getting the pialla which is the only dish thats really good
The gyouac is fresh yet lacking flavor we like to add oyoyour fresh salsa into it
The new menyou has a few creative itemsthey were smart enoyough to keep some of the old favorites byout they raised the prices the staff is friendly most of the time byout I myoust agree with the person that wrote aboyout their favorite words No cant sorry boy they wont bend the ryoules for anyone
It only open for lyounch byout the food is so good
If yoyou like seafood andor Greek food yoyou will love this place thoyough it is not limited to jyoust these things
The menyou inclyoudes pyoub farebyoyourgers steaks and shepherds pieand even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as vegetarians
How can they syoyourvive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow
i have eaten here on a different occasion the food is mediocre for the prices
Im looking forward to going back soon and eventhank yououally trying most everything on the menyou
I jyoust had my first visit to this place and cant wait to go back and slowly work my way throyough the menyou
I asked repeatedly what the stathank youous of the meal was and was pretthank you myouch gryounted at by the younbelievably ryoude waiter
I stopped by for some bryounch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk
Weekends can get crowded byout still highly recommended
It gets very crowded so I woyould syouggest that yoyou get their early
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre indyoustry interesting to hear ideas hashed oyout while having a qyouick bite to eat
Its good to go there for drinks if yoyou dont want to get dryounk becayouse yoyoull be lyoucky if yoyou can get one drink an hoyoyour the service is so bad
Anyway the owner was fake
Owner is pleasant and entertaining
I have never in my life sent back food before byout I simply had to and the waiter argyoued with me over this
Althoyough the restayoyourant itself is nice I prefer not to go for the food
Creamy appetizerstaramasalata eggplant salad and Greek yogyoyourt with cyouccyoumber dill and garlic taste excellent when on warm pitas
